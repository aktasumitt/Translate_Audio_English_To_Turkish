 With its compact size and streets packed with eye candy of all sorts, New York City is an urban wanderer's delight. Every neighborhood offers a dramatically different version of the city, from the 100-year-old Jewish delis of the Upper West Side to the brightly painted Buddhist temples in Chinatown. And the best way to experience it all is to walk its streets.
